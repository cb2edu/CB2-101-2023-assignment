#estimate the number of mitochondria in the human body

#known fact - a human cell typically contains several hundred to a few thousand mitochondria

#assumptions - about 30 trillion cells in a human body

#estimate - around 1000 mitochondria / cell

#final calculation based on assumptions and estimates - 30 trillion cells x 1000 mitochondria / cell = 30 quadrillion mitochondria
