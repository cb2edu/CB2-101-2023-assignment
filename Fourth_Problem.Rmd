Question: How many people car mechanic are there in Kansas City?

Answer: 

Total Population: 509319 (source: google)
Car ownership: let's assume 80% people owns car
Avg number of car per household: 2 per home
Ratio of car mechanic: 1:200

Estimated Number of Car Mechanics = (Population×(Car Ownership Rate/100)×Average Cars per Household)/Ratio of Cars to Mechanics

Estimated Number of Car Mechanics=(509319×(80/100)×2)/200 = 4074.55 ~ 4075 mechanics
